Ultimately, every move needs to be boiled down to algebraic expression, e.g. a4-a5

i) Convert the spoken integer to its proper coordinate on the board.
ii) Convert any intermediary words into a dash or an x, depending on the move. 

A simple movement is merely a dash. 

An x is simply a cross. 

"32 captures 33" --> ___x___

"32 moves to 33" --> ___-___

"move 32 to 33" --> ___-___

FOOLPROOF LOGIC: 

-The first number is the unit being picked up, the second number is the box to be moved to. 

"I want to move 32 to 33": 32 --> 33

"Take my pawn at 32 and move it to 33": 32 --> 33

"Take my piece at 32 and take the enemy at 33.": 32 --> 33

"Move 32 back to 24." 32 --> 24
